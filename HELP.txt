Step-1: Install Xampp to default location of your computer.

        whenever it asks for your permission.

Step-3: Click Start button(Apache) & Start button(MySql).They would be showing Running status
        (in green) when you are done with the previous instructions.

Step-5: Copy 'Business_companion' folder (the one with capital'B') to the location:'C:\xampp\htdocs\'.

Questions may arise:

1.What is 'Entry ID' & where can i find it?

Ans:If you dont know the entry id,which is obvious as that is determined by default by Business Companion.But You can view the entry 
Id using the view option where you can put the reference id you remember,It will inform you the entry Id as well as other informations.

2.What to do if the image doesn't works correctly?

Ans:Use 'Free Picture Resizer' to resize the image dimension.Open the image you want to store,then click the resize icon.Uncheck lock 
aspect ratio.Fix the new size as 620 in width and 400 in height.Click ok & save as a new image.Use this new image to store.

####IMPORTANT#####
If you are thinking about changing your operating system,obviously you wouldn't want to erase all the data/entries stored.Then you
must copy the folder 'C:\xampp\mysql\data\buisness_companion' to your backup and replace the previous one.I would suggest to do so
often cause you never know when your computer/OS is going to crush.
